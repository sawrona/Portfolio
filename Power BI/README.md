The goal of this Power BI dashboard is to identify and monitor areas of the inventory that are facing challenges with payment collections. Specifically, it focuses on tracking portfolios that are moving from one delinquent bucket to the next, highlighting those that are at risk of further delinquency. This allows users to pinpoint the systems and accounts that are struggling to make timely payments, with an emphasis on those that are 60+ days past due. By doing so, the dashboard provides insights into both the number of systems in delinquency and the outstanding monetary amounts, helping users prioritize collections efforts and make informed decisions on how to manage overdue payments.

**Key Features:**
1. Two-Paged Design:

    - Main Page: The first page of the dashboard offers a high-level, macro view of the entire inventory, providing an overview of payment statuses across all portfolios. It aggregates the total number of systems that are 60+ days past due and the total outstanding amounts, offering a quick snapshot of the current delinquency status.
    - Detailed Page: The second page dives deeper into the 60+ days delinquency category, breaking down payments by aged buckets (e.g., 60-90 days, 90-120 days, etc.). This enables users to analyze the progression of delinquency, identifying which specific time frames are seeing the most significant backlogs and which systems are at the greatest risk of moving into more severe delinquency buckets.
2. Linked Filters: At the top of each page, there are filters that enable users to dynamically interact with the data. These filters are consistent across both pages, ensuring that any adjustments made on one page automatically apply to the other. This allows users to refine their analysis based on specific variables such as time periods, regions, account types, or portfolios.

3. Data Segmentation: By separating the delinquent accounts into distinct aged buckets, the dashboard allows for a nuanced understanding of payment delays. The aging of the portfolio is clearly visible, helping users identify trends and patterns, such as whether certain accounts or portfolios are consistently late, and if the outstanding amounts are increasing over time.

4. Running Report: When a user clicks the "Go to Report" button, the report will mirror the filters based on the user's inputs. There they will have the option to export the data.
