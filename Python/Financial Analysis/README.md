**Case Study: Analyzing Profitability Trends Across Segments and Regions
Problem Statement**
How do different market segments and countries contribute to overall profitability, and what trends can be identified over time?

This case study aims to uncover which business segments and regions drive the most profit, whether discounts impact profitability, and how seasonal trends affect sales performance.

**Approach**
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation:

- Handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Convert date columns to proper formats for time-based analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyze total sales, cost of goods sold (COGS), and profit across different segments and countries.
- Identify trends in profitability over months and years.
- Investigate the impact of discount bands on profit margins.
3. Visualizations:

- A bar chart to compare total profit by country and segment.
- A line plot showing profitability trends over time.
- A heatmap to analyze seasonal sales trends across months and years.

**Expected Insights**
- Which countries and market segments are the most profitable?
- Do discounts positively or negatively impact overall profitability?
- Are there seasonal patterns in sales performance?

**Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration
