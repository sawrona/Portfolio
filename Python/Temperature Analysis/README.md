**Overview**

This project analyzes how monthly average temperatures have changed over the past decade in a given city. By visualizing temperature trends, we can identify potential warming or cooling patterns and understand seasonal variations.

Problem Statement

How has the monthly average temperature changed over the past century, and can we visualize trends in warming or cooling?


**Methodology**

1. Data Generation: Since real-world historical temperature data may not always be available, this project generates synthetic temperature data from 2014 to 2024, incorporating seasonal trends, gradual warming effects, and random noise.

2. Data Visualization:

- A line plot to show how average monthly temperatures vary over the years.

- A bar chart to illustrate yearly average temperature trends.

3. Analysis: Observing the visual trends helps in understanding whether there is a noticeable warming effect over the years.

**Technologies Used**

- Python

- Pandas (for data manipulation)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

- NumPy (for generating synthetic data)

**Key Insights**

- The line plot reveals seasonal temperature variations and how each year compares.

- The bar chart helps visualize the long-term temperature trend over the years, highlighting any warming patterns.
