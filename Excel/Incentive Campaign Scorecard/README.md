**Overview**

This scorecard tracks the number of customers who have made payments toward their prepayment or fully paid off their loans. It also calculates the invoice amounts based on gift card values and determines the total collected through various campaigns.

**Calculations**

To ensure accuracy and efficiency, the scorecard is automatically updated using built-in Excel formulas, including:

- COUNTIFS – To count customers meeting specific criteria
- SUMIFS – To aggregate payments based on defined conditions
- MAX / MIN – To identify the highest and lowest payment amounts

Additionally, partial payments are defined as transactions exceeding $1,000 to exclude standard monthly payment amounts.
